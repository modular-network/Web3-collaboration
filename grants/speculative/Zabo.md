# Zabo

## Project Description
* We connect application developers and users with existing crypto wallets and infrastructure using a single interface. Users bring their own custodial or non-custodial wallet, not Zaboâ€™s, and we connect it. Developers work with a single API to connect with any wallet.
* We feel much of the ecosystem has developed fragmented solutions to common problems, especially when it comes to cryptocurrency itself and the wallets that hold it. Today, as a user, when you connect to a new application, you generally use the target application's new wallet, while we have dozens of wallet options already available. Additionally, there are numerous exchanges globally, each with their api to access custodial wallets. Rather than provide another wallet, we aim to bring existing wallets and networks together through a standard pipeline via a familiar interface.
* Zabo will facilitate sending transactions to parachains on the Polkadot network by integrating wallet providers that support these transactions. Additionally, we will offer data endpoints to receive information from these parachains.
* Our team has been building blockchain solutions together for a few years now. We noticed this issue of fragmented wallets and wallet interfaces as we developed for the financial industry and decided this was an important issue to solve. Better developer experience leads to better user experience because developers can offload non-core technical issues.

## Development Roadmap
We currently have a baseline MVP version published as v0.1.0 and will require 6 months to complete v1.0. For the Polkadot grant portion, we will require 2 months to complete. We intend on having 5 working full-time on this project. Total cost estimate shared in Google Form.

### Milestone 1 - Research and Design - 1 month - $0
We will research polkadot-js api and the polkadot-js extension, as well as current implementations in polkadot-ui and at polkadot.js.org/apps to design open source js and golang sdks capable of communicating with a locally hosted and remotely hosted node connected to the Alexander testnet (or its equivalent at the time of implementation). We will also design a proof of concept which shows how a web application can leverage mobile wallets for account information and transaction signing through HTTP and deep linking.   

  * Research the current Polkadot API's
  * Design the following default substrate functions into the Zabo Client API:
    - `query.balances.freeBalance()`
    - `rpc.state.queryStorage()` to obtain historical storage entries for the connected wallet
    - `tx.staking.bond()`
    - `tx.staking.nominate()`
    - `tx.staking.chill()`
    - `tx.staking.unbond()`
    - `tx.staking.withdrawUnbonded()`
    - `tx.balances.transfer()`
  * Design protocol to leverage mobile wallets from a web app.   

We will deliver fully documented sdks at the end of this milestone.

### Milestone 2 - Implement Design - 1 month - $12.5k
We will implement the designed sdks and make them available via github. These sdks will allow application users to select a local keystore, a polkadot-js extension managed keystore, or provide a public address, read only connection to utilize an application powered by the Polkadot sdks.

We will deliver a simple web app capable of interacting with the Alexander testnet utilizing the developed SDKs and make this application available via a Docker image. The application will also be open sourced and made available on Github.

### Milestone 3 - Implement Mobile Wallet Protocol - 2 months - $12.5k
We will build out a proof-of-concept protocol designed to allow the sdk powered web application to leverage a mobile wallet keystore. This protocol will allow extrinsic data to be sent to, signed, and sent to the recipient network.

We will deliver a protocol capable of integrating with Polkawallet, Speckle, and Enzyme for Polkadot functionality. We will also deliver the capability to execute cryptocurrency transactions through Ledger, Trezor, and Metamask. This protocol will also interoperate with the WalletConnect protocol to support those mobile wallets. For Polkadot functionality, we will either work with these teams to implement a working proof of concept capable of signing a request and submitting it to the Alexander testnet, or fork at least one of these projects to implement the proof of concept ourselves.

### Payment Type
We would be willing to take 100% payment in DOTs.

### Ongoing Support
We intend to continue building out and supporting the Zabo API into the future as an ongoing concern. We plan on active engagment in the developer and user communities so that we can receive accurate feedback on development priorities.
