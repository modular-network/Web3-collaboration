# Zabo

## Project Description
* We connect application developers and users with existing crypto wallets and infrastructure using a single interface. Users bring their own custodial or non-custodial wallet, not Zaboâ€™s, and we connect it. Developers work with a single API to connect with any wallet.
* We feel much of the ecosystem has developed fragmented solutions to common problems, especially when it comes to cryptocurrency itself and the wallets that hold it. Today, as a user, when you connect to a new application, you generally use the target application's new wallet, while we have dozens of wallet options already available. Additionally, there are numerous exchanges globally, each with their api to access custodial wallets. Rather than provide another wallet, we aim to bring existing wallets and networks together through a standard pipeline via a familiar interface.
* Zabo will facilitate sending transactions to parachains on the Polkadot network by integrating wallet providers that support these transactions. Additionally, we will offer data endpoints to receive information from these parachains.
* Our team has been building blockchain solutions together for a few years now. We noticed this issue of fragmented wallets and wallet interfaces as we developed for the financial industry and decided this was an important issue to solve. Better developer experience leads to better user experience because developers can offload non-core technical issues.

## Development Roadmap
We currently have a baseline MVP version published as v0.1.0 and will require 6 months to complete v1.0. For the Polkadot grant portion, we will require 2 months to complete. We intend on having 5 working full-time on this project. Total cost estimate shared in Google Form.

Milestones:   
* Research wallet providers intending to serve the Polkadot network (week 1)
* Study current interfaces to these wallets and setup discussion with the wallet teams (weeks 2 - 4)
* Choose wallets to include and design integration (weeks 5 - 6)
* Setup Polkadot testnet collator for most viable parachain (weeks 5 - 6, in parallel)
* Include wallets in the Zabo sandbox (weeks 7)
* Include Polkadot data API in sandbox (weeks 7 - 8)

The final goal will be at least 2 wallets serving the Polkadot ecosystem integrated into the Zabo sandbox. The Zabo sandbox also providing Polkadot testnet balance and transaction history data via API.

We can receive payment at the end, when the Polkadot portion of our project is complete.

We would be willing to take 100% payment in DOTs.

We intend to continue building out and supporting the Zabo API into the future as an ongoing concern. We plan on active engagment in the developer and user communities so that we can receive accurate feedback on development priorities.
